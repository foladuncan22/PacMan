# PacMan

Description - This is the PacMan coding assignment from Week4 of the MIT xPro Coding bootcamp. When run, the image of PacMan switches between a open and closed mouth right-facing PacMan, until it hits the border of the page. At that point, PacMan turns around and chomps in the other direction until he hits the left border.

Installation - This project is still under construction, as I'm still tryng to figure out the correct calculation for the pageWidth. Upon adjusting the if statement on line 47, my PacMan either goes on infinitely in one direction or moves back-and-forth in one spot. 
Support - I would love any assistance in figuring out the correct condition for my if-statement. I am in the Discord for the program and can be reached there!

Roadmap - As mentioned in Installation, I plan to continue toggling with the if-statement on line 47 to figure out how to get PacMan to move to and stop at the border of the page. I started with the statement "if(pos = pageWidth)" or  "if(pos < pageWidth)" and the PacMan chomped in the right direction infintely. When using  "if(pos > pageWidth)" or  "if(pos >= pageWidth)", PacMan chomps back in forth in one spot. I tried using a while statement and the PacMan images did not switch at all and did not move. I will continue trying other options.
